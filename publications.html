            <p class="abstract">
                In order to learn the meanings of words, children must solve
                two potentially separable tasks: to learn the mappings between
                words and their meanings, and to learn the <em>concepts</em>
                that underlie those meanings. This chapter examines the acquisition
                of negation by taking each of these tasks in turn. We argue that
                children's limited early uses of negation words reflect limited
                early meanings, but that the slow emergence of logical negation
                can be fully explained by the difficulty of learning the linguistic
                mappings, without the need to appeal to additional conceptual
                difficulty. Further, we argue that
                children are in posession of at least a precursor to the concept
                of logical negation—<span class = "sc">contrary</span>—by 17 months.
                Even so, it remains possible
                that some conceptual development occurs between when children
                first use the word "no", and when they finally learn its truth-functional
                logical meaning, and we spell out a proposal for how the
                logically limited concept <span class = "sc">contrary</span> could contribute to
                the construction of the concept <span class = "sc">negation</span>. Finally, to
                test the possibility that langauge itself plays a role in the
                construction of <span class = "sc">negation</span>, we propose
                that future work
                compare children's acquisition of negation across languages
                with varying mappings between words and meanings.

            <p class="abstract">
                Previous research has suggested several stages for children’s production of
                 negation. Some researchers have argued that the order of morpheme production
                 follows a "no-not-n't" cline. Others have hypothesized stages where "no" appears
                 outside the sentence and a stage where "can't" and "don't" are learned as
                 unanalyzed wholes because "can" and "do" are not produced separately. In this
                 study we bring more corpus data and novel analyses to bear on these hypotheses.
                 The results suggest that "no" is produced earlier but "not" and "n't" are
                 produced around the same time. We do not find evidence for a presentential
                 stage or a stage where negative auxiliaries like "can't" and "don't" are
                 produced without the positive forms like "can" and "do". Our findings are
                 compatible with simultaneous development of frequent negative forms with a
                 production bottleneck that favors shorter utterances like "no" to appear earlier.
