            <p class="abstract">
                Previous research has suggested several stages for children’s production of
                 negation. Some researchers have argued that the order of morpheme production 
                 follows a "no-not-n't" cline. Others have hypothesized stages where "no" appears 
                 outside the sentence and a stage where "can't" and "don't" are learned as 
                 unanalyzed wholes because "can" and "do" are not produced separately. In this 
                 study we bring more corpus data and novel analyses to bear on these hypotheses. 
                 The results suggest that "no" is produced earlier but "not" and "n't" are 
                 produced around the same time. We do not find evidence for a presentential 
                 stage or a stage where negative auxiliaries like "can't" and "don't" are 
                 produced without the positive forms like "can" and "do". Our findings are 
                 compatible with simultaneous development of frequent negative forms with a 
                 production bottleneck that favors shorter utterances like "no" to appear earlier.
