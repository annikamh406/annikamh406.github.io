            <h2 class="pub-title">The acquisition of negation: International
                adoption separates cognitive development from language knowledge</h2>
            <p class="abstract">
                Logical negation, which reverses the truth value of a sentence,
                is essential to human communication. Children learning English
                begin saying no around their first birthday, but their first
                uses are limited to particular social functions, like rejection.
                Not until nearly a year later do children begin producing and
                understanding clearly logical uses of negation words. One
                possible cause of this delay is that children struggle to
                learn the mapping between the concept of negation and negation
                words—a <b>linguistic bottleneck</b>. Alternatively, children might
                struggle to learn the concept itself—a <b>conceptual bottleneck</b>.
                We tested these hypotheses by comparing negation production in
                typical English-learners and internationally-adopted
                preschoolers. Adopted preschoolers are more conceptually mature 
                than infants but face a similar language-learning task. If
                first-language learners face a conceptual bottleneck, then
                adoptees should learn negation faster. If the main bottleneck
                is linguistic, then the two groups should learn negation at the
                same rate relative to their acquisition of English. In Study 1
                we found that according to parent reports on the MB-CDI,
                international adoptees and language-matched infant
                first-language learners begin producing no and not at the same
                point in vocabulary growth. In Study 2, we examined children’s
                production of logical denial negation in large-scale
                aturalistic corpora. We found that adopted preschoolers’ and
                language-matched infants’ production of denials increased at
                the same rate as the mean length of children’s utterances
                increased. The matching patterns of negation acquisition in
                internationally-adopted preschoolers and first-language-learning
                infants support a linguistic, not conceptual, bottleneck on the
                acquisition of negation.

            <p class="abstract">
                In order to learn the meanings of words, children must solve
                two potentially separable tasks: to learn the mappings between
                words and their meanings, and to learn the <em>concepts</em>
                that underlie those meanings. This chapter examines the acquisition
                of negation by taking each of these tasks in turn. We argue that
                children's limited early uses of negation words reflect limited
                early meanings, but that the slow emergence of logical negation
                can be fully explained by the difficulty of learning the linguistic
                mappings, without the need to appeal to additional conceptual
                difficulty. Further, we argue that
                children are in posession of at least a precursor to the concept
                of logical negation—<span class = "sc">contrary</span>—by 17 months.
                Even so, it remains possible
                that some conceptual development occurs between when children
                first use the word "no", and when they finally learn its truth-functional
                logical meaning, and we spell out a proposal for how the
                logically limited concept <span class = "sc">contrary</span> could contribute to
                the construction of the concept <span class = "sc">negation</span>. Finally, to
                test the possibility that langauge itself plays a role in the
                construction of <span class = "sc">negation</span>, we propose
                that future work
                compare children's acquisition of negation across languages
                with varying mappings between words and meanings.

            <p class="abstract">
                Previous research has suggested several stages for children’s production of
                 negation. Some researchers have argued that the order of morpheme production
                 follows a "no-not-n't" cline. Others have hypothesized stages where "no" appears
                 outside the sentence and a stage where "can't" and "don't" are learned as
                 unanalyzed wholes because "can" and "do" are not produced separately. In this
                 study we bring more corpus data and novel analyses to bear on these hypotheses.
                 The results suggest that "no" is produced earlier but "not" and "n't" are
                 produced around the same time. We do not find evidence for a presentential
                 stage or a stage where negative auxiliaries like "can't" and "don't" are
                 produced without the positive forms like "can" and "do". Our findings are
                 compatible with simultaneous development of frequent negative forms with a
                 production bottleneck that favors shorter utterances like "no" to appear earlier.
