                Acquisition of specific negative functions
                prior to logical negation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Anyone who has spent any time around a toddler knows that “no”
                is one of their earliest and most frequently used words.
                But it isn’t until around—or just after—their second
                birthday that children seem to understand “no”
                when it is used to express the logical, truth-functional
                meaning of negation. What is happening during this interim
                period—sometimes close to a year!—during which children
                produce, but do not seem to understand, “no”?
            </p>

            <p>I am exploring two competing hypotheses:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Children <strong>do</strong> know the logical meaning of
                    negation early on, but they fail tasks that test
                    comprehension of logical negation
                    because those tasks impose additional executive-function
                    demands that overwhelm them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When children first use the word "no", they think it has
                    simpler meanings like <em>Rejection</em>, <em>Prohibition</em>,
                    <em>Nonexistence</em>, or <em>Metalinguistic negation</em>,
                    and they don't learn the full
                    logical negation meaning of "no" until later.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                I am developing a series of studies exploring whether children
                can succeed at tasks like those used to test comprehension of
                logical negation, but in which the negation words are used to
                express other, possibly easier-learned functions of negation,
                like <em>Rejection</em>, <em>Prohibition</em>,
                <em>Nonexistence</em>, and <em>Metalinguistic negation</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If children do take a full year to learn the logical
                negation meaning of "no", even after they have begun to
                produce "no", that may imply that children struggle
                to learn to logical, truth-functional concept
                <span class="sc">negation</span>.

        </div>
        <div class="research-box">
            <h3>Cross-linguistic comparisons</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to expressing logical negation, the word "no" in
                English can serve several less abstract conversational functions,
                such as rejecting or prohibiting. Because of this, a child learning
                English might well initially hypothesize that "no" <em>means</em>
                <span class="sc">rejection</span> or <span class="sc">prohibition</span>—
                in fact, as I've described above, many of their first uses of "no"
                reflect these simpler meanings.
            </p>

            <p>
                In contrast, in Tagalog, for instance, the function of rejection is
                expressed using "ayaw", and prohibition is expressed using "huwag",
                and so the logical negator "hindi" is left for more obviously
                truth-functional contexts. As a result, children learning Tagalog
                never have cause to hypothesize that "hindi" <em>means</em>
                <span class="sc">rejection</span> or <span class="sc">prohibition</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                How might this difference in linguistic structure affect how
                children learn negation? If the concept <span class = "sc">negation</span>
                is difficult to learn, then maybe clustered simpler meanings
                on one word like in English could help children form the necessary
                abstraction to learn the concept. On the other hand, if the main
                task is linguistic, then maybe a more 1-1 mapping between meanings
                and words, like in Tagalog, would be easier to resolve.
            </p>

            <h4>Cross-linguistic corpus analysis</h4>

            <p>
                I am using Bayesian growth-curve
                analyses to compare the emergence of
                logical Denial negation
                in large corpora of naturally-produced children's
                speech in 5 languages—Spanish, English, German, Hebrew, and
                Tagalog—that have varying numbers of meanings mapped to a single
                word. If clustered meanings on a single word facilitate
                conceptual development, then we predict that children
                learning English and Spanish should learn Denial negation fastest,
                and children learning Tagalog should learn slowest, relative
                to their overall language acquisition. If instead the main task is
                learning meaning mappings, then we predict that children learning Tagalog
                should learn Denial fastest, and children learning English and
                Spanish should learn slowest.
            </p>

            <h4>Comprehension studies in Tagalog</h4>
            <p>
                I am spearheading a collaboration
                with the University of the Philippines, Manila to replicate tests
                of negation comprehension, including those described above
                designed to test specific functions of negation, in children
                learning Tagalog. Crucially, we are testing comprehension of
                both the function-specific negators and the logical negator.
                For instance, we are testing comprehension of rejection using
                the rejection-specific negator "ayaw" and the logical negator
                "hindi". This will both allow us to confirm our assumption that,
                unlike children learning English, children learning Tagalog
                do not assign other, more specific meanings to their logical
                negator, and to better understand how the timeline of acquiring
                negation differs between Tagalog and English.

            <h3>Domain generality of early negation-like concepts</h3>
            <p>
                Even before they begin to understant or produce logical negation,
                children seem to have some ability to think with negation-like
                concepts. Around 17 months, children begin to succeed on a
                collection of tasks in various domains involving reasoning in a disjunctive
                syllogism format—A or B; not A; therefore B. Does this
                sudden flurry of successes reflect a major conceptual development—for
                instance, the ability to <em>exclude</em> an option from consideration?
                Or does it merely reflect an improvement in auiliary capacities
                like inhibition or working memory?
            </p>
            <p>
                I am designing a novel
                structural-priming task to test whether children are
                using the same concept to solve disjunctive syllogism tasks
                in different domains. Children will be exposed to a disjunctive
                syllogism task in one domain (e.g., a search task), and then tested
                in another domain (e.g., a causal disambiguation task). If they
                are employing some domain-general logical concept on both tasks,
                then exposure to one task should prime the use of that concept on
                the second task. If, instead, children are relying on more
                domain specific strategies for success (e.g., a search algorithm,
                or a heuristic like <em>avoid empty</em>),
                then there should be no effect of priming.
